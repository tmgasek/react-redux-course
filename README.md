This repo is for me to record my progress on the react-redux course my Stephen Grider.
My aim is to build a solid understanding of foundations involved in the usage of react & redux for making quality scalable web apps.
These repos will contain a mixture of code being provided by the course and my own refactors as the course uses predominately class based components and some older libraries that I will replace with hook based code.
